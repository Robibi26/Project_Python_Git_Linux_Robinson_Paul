## Project Overview

We developed a professional interactive dashboard designed for an asset management context.  
The application retrieves financial market data, applies quantitative analysis, and displays results in a clear and user-friendly way.

## Project Structure

The dashboard is composed of two main modules:

### Quant A – Single Asset Analysis
- Analysis of one asset at a time  
- Historical price visualization  
- Strategy backtesting (e.g. buy & hold, momentum)  
- Performance metrics:
  - Sharpe Ratio  
  - Volatility  
  - Maximum Drawdown  
- Interactive controls for strategy parameters  
- Main chart showing:
  - Raw asset price  
  - Cumulative strategy performance

### Quant B – Multi-Asset Portfolio Analysis
- Portfolio construction using at least 3 CAC 40 assets  
- Portfolio simulation:
  - Equal-weight allocation  
  - Custom weights  
- Portfolio performance visualization (base 100)  
- Correlation matrix between assets  
- Diversification analysis  
- Portfolio metrics:
  - Annualized return  
  - Volatility  
  - Sharpe Ratio  
  - Maximum Drawdown  
- Visual comparison between individual assets and the portfolio
